<h3 class="projectHeader">Shopping List</h3>
<p>React Native</p>

<p class="projectDesc">
  Part of a React-Native crash course, my first experience with
  React-Native, Android Studio, and deploying an app to the play
  store.
</p>

<p class="projectDesc">
  Simple shopping list made using React Native, and deployed to Google
  Play Store. Enter name, then add an item, delete items. Getting the
  build version of the app, and going through the deployment on the
  Google Play Store were the hardest parts of this project.
</p>

<p class="projectDesc">
  I found it easy to work with, being so close to React-Dom, once you
  learn the React-Native components the styling is almost the same as
  normal CSS.
  I loved being able to connect my phone, and see hot-reload changes
  on my device as with a normal React dev server.
